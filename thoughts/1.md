# What I Learned In My First Year Of Grad School

This blurb is very specific to me and my experience, so take this as you will. As I am writing it I feel some level of guilt about the whole thing, because often I read these posts and they are already from the perspective of the reader, whereas this is really just some self-centered rant. I suppose my goal is that by discussing my experience I can help someone in thinking about their own experience. Perhaps I could rewrite the whole thing to be about "one's experience" or something like that, but another part of me feels that this may be too much projection. I am not sure.


## Physical and mental health is very important.

## Practicing reading 

## Humans are imperfect. Mistakes are inevitable and natural. Being imperfect is ok.






### Do I have the authority to speak on this?

No, not really. Well, perhaps as much authority as anyone else in my position. I have presented this as being what I have learned in my first year of grad school. And well, I have completed my first year of grad school, and I learned at least one thing, so therefore I should be able to discuss it. If I have made a mistake in writing this earnestly, then that is ok.

### Did this need to be shared?

No.
